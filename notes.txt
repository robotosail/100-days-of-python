# Comparison Operators

    Operators       Meaning
    ---------       --------
        >           Greater than
        <           Less than
        >=          Greater than or equal to
        <=          Less than or equal to
        ==          Equal to
        !=          Not equal to
        %           Divdes a number by another number and gives you the remainder
    
* Remeber that one equal sign means that you are assigning to a variable, while two means you are checking.

# Data Types: --

    # Strings:
        # "Hello"[4] # the [] allows you to pull out a letter in a string.
        # The string function converts any data to a string.
        # num_char = len(input("What is your name? ")).
        # new_num_char = str(num_char).
        # print("Your name has "+ new_num_char + " characters.").

    # Integer:
        # print(123 + 245) # in order to add numbers you remove the quotations.
        # in order to add separation in numbers use underscore instead of commas.
            # 123_123

    # Float:
        # 3.14159.

    # Boolean:
        # True.
        # False.
    # list:
        an array of things differenciated by the [] symbol
        each item in a list is seperated by a comma
        things are gotten by their index value

        ## usage:
            list = ["hi", "2"]
            print(list[0])
    # dict/dictionaries:
        they are initialized by using the {} symbol
        things are gotten in key and values
        each item must have quotations around it
        ## usage:
            dict = {"key": "value"}
            print(dict["key"])
    # tuples:
        similar to list only differenciated by the () instead of a []
        similar to list it uses index position to get an item
        Unlike the values of tuples cannot be changed it stays constant
        ## usage:
            my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
            print(my_tuple[0])

#--------- Examples ------------
    ### Strip
        char = "dsajlfkdsajl kldsajflkdsajf"
        print(char.strip())
    ###
    ### open
        ## to read a file
            file = open("the file you want to open")
            contents = file.read() # returns the contents in the file

            #better practice
            with open("the file you want to open") as file:
                contents = file.read()
                print(contents)

        ## write into a file
        if the file doesn't exist is creates it for you
            with open("test.txt", mode="w") as file: # w stands for write
                file.write("This is a test")    <----------------|
            * note this method deletes everything in the file ---|

#----------#

# Global Scope:
    # player_health = 10

    # def game():
    #     def drink_potion():
    #         # the variable player_health is accessible for all because it is a global scope
    #         potion_strength = 2
    #         print(player_health)
    #     # putting the function call outside of the game function doesn't allow it to be called because it doesn't have access to the game function
    #     drink_potion()
    # inorder to get access to the global scope in a function you use the key word global

    Example:
    player_health = 1
    def game():
        global player_health
        player_health = 2
        print(player_health)
    game()


# Local Scope - it exists within functions

    # def drink_potion():
    #     # the variable potion_strength is only accessible in this function
    #     potion_strength = 2
    #     print(potion_strength)

    # drink_potion()
    # print(potion_strength)

## imports:
    # Basic import
        # import turtle
        # turtle = turtle.Turtle()

    # from import
        from turtle import turtle
        # turtle = Turtle()
    # import all
        it allows for easy access but can get confused with other functions in your code
        from turtle import *
        forward(100)
    # import as alias
        # from turtle import whatevernameyouwant
        turtle = whatevernameyouwant()

    # slice:
        the first digit it the start to splice the list the second digit specifies where to stop, the third digit specifies the step count
        # works with tuples
        piano = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
        # gets every from index two to the end of the list so - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        print(piano[2:])
        # gets every from index two to 5 from the list so - 3, 4, 5, 6
        print(piano[2:5])
        # gets every from index two to 5 from the list and steps by 2 so - 3, 4, 5, 6
        print(piano[2:5:2])
        print(piano[::2])

interms of font size
562.5% => 90px, 100% => 16px, 1em = 16px
em and percentages get inherited from the parent
so if the parent has a default font size and the child has a font-size both font sizes will be added together
rem ignores all of the parents default font size and uses its own in the em 
rem should be the perferred unit

float:
it works with itmes that generate boxes, and don't have absolute values

clear:
it is the opposite of float, it makes sure the item isn't adjacent to the other items

Setting Environment Variables in command prompt:

    method 1 (Temporary - deletes when terminal is exited):
        set Key=value

    method 2 (permanent - stays even upon exiting terminal):
        setx key "value"

Setting Environment Variables in powershell:
    method 1 (permanent - stays even upon exiting terminal):
        setx key "value"
    method 2 (Temporary - deletes once terminal is closed):
        $Env:key = "value"


Beautiful Soup usage:
    #------------- Beautiful Soup -----------------#
    # from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    # # import lxml

    # # add the encdoing param so you dont get any errors with unicode characters like emojis and stuff like that
    # with open("website.html", encoding="utf8") as file:
    #     contents = file.read()

    # # making soup
    # # first specify the file content, nect the parser that help understand the lang the content is structured in
    # soup = BeautifulSoup(markup=contents, features="html.parser")

    # # getting the string in the title tag
    # print(soup.title.string)

    # # prints the indented version of the html
    # # print(soup.prettify())

    # # getting the anchor tag - Note it only gets the first item it has found
    # print(soup.a)

    # # Getting all instances of a tag
    # all_anchor_tag = soup.find_all(name="a")

    # # getting only the text
    # for tag in all_anchor_tag:
    #     # print(tag.getText())  # gets only the text
    #     print(tag.get("href"))  # gets the value of the specified attribute

    # # gets and item using any attribute
    # # applies to when there is only one of that item esle use find all
    # heading = soup.find(name="h1", id="name")
    # print(heading)
    # section_heading = soup.find(name="h3", class_="heading")
    # print(section_heading.get("name"))

    # # this gets the anchor tag that is within a paragraph tag
    # company_url = soup.select_one(selector="p a")
    # print(company_url)

    # # it is not restricted to only tags, also works with css selectors like ids and classes etc.
    # name = soup.select_one(selector="#name")
    # print(name)

    # # returns a list of all possible items that have a class of heading
    # headings = soup.select(".heading")
    # print(headings)
