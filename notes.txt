        %           Divdes a number by another number and gives you the remainder
    
* Remeber that one equal sign means that you are assigning to a variable, while two means you are checking.

# Data Types: --

    # Strings:
        # "Hello"[4] # the [] allows you to pull out a letter in a string.
        # The string function converts any data to a string.
        # num_char = len(input("What is your name? ")).
        # new_num_char = str(num_char).
        # print("Your name has "+ new_num_char + " characters.").

    # Integer:
        # print(123 + 245) # in order to add numbers you remove the quotations.
        # in order to add separation in numbers use underscore instead of commas.
            # 123_123

    # Float:
        # 3.14159.

    # Boolean:
        # True.
        # False.

# Functions:
    # Type:-
        # checks the type of data it is; wheter strings or integer
        # type()

    # Round:-
        # rounds numbers up or down
        # used by using round()
        # allows you to choose the position to round to

    # Float:-
        # turns a number into a float
        # a = float(123)
        # print(type(a))
    
    # Str:-
        
        # 
    # F Strings:-
        # it allows you to mix multiple data types together.
        # use it by putting f in front of the " sign and the puting the different data types inside of a {}

### Expressions
    # Mathematical expression
    # 3 + 5 # the addition sign
    # 3 - 5 # the subtraction sign
    # 3 * 5 # the multiplication sign
    # 3 / 5 # the division sign
    # 2 ** 2 # The exponent sign
    # 2 // 3 # The float sign; it removes the decimal from the result 
    # result = 4/2, 
    # result /= 4/2 # The /= continues the division
###

                #--------- Examples ------------
### Round
